> Generalized DNA for building real-time shared-state hApps on holochain

Syn: Etymology. From Ancient Greek œÉœÖŒº- (sum-), variant of œÉœÖŒΩ- (sun-), from œÉœçŒΩ (s√∫n, ‚Äúwith, in company with, together with‚Äù).

## Design

This project makes it easy to build collaborative apps in the distributed peer-to-peer context of Holochain.  Syn uses Holochain's infrastructure for data integrity and peer-to-peer networking to store regular "commits" of the shared content's state, while coordinating batches of delta's that comprise those commits between nodes.  The approach is generalized for many different use-cases, where the app-developer need only define:
1. A renderer for content state
2. A patch-grammar for applying deltas to content
3. A function to apply deltas to the content state
4. Any user interaction that should generate those deltas in the given grammar

For more details read the [design documents](DESIGN.md), read the [article](https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/), and check out the example app, SynText, in the [/ui](ui/) directory.

## Installation

1. Install the holochain dev environment: https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/syn && cd ./syn`
3. Enter the nix shell: `nix-shell`

## Building the DNA

- Build the DNA (assumes you are still in the nix shell for correct rust/cargo versions from step above):
  - Assemble the DNA:

  ```bash
  make build
  ```

## UI

We have provided a sample UI that implements collaborative text editing in a minimal editor. To run this UI in test mode you can spin up two test instances of the dna using the `hc` dev tool like this:

```bash
hc sandbox generate \
  --run=8888,8889 \
  --app-id syn \
  --num-sandboxes 2 \
  network \
    --bootstrap https://bootstrap-staging.holo.host \
    quic
```
Then you can run the UI with:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```
Now open two tabs in your browser pointing at `http://localhost:5000`.  In the second tab, change the `appPort` to `8889`. Then click 'Connect'. Now you should be able to see both agents and start editing text on either tab and see it appear on the other.

### Testing

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

#### Unit testing

  The `make test-unit` command runs all the unit tests for zomes in cargo.

  #### dna tryorama testing

  The `make test-dna` command packages/installs a fresh DNA and @holochain/tryorama tests it.

  ### Flushing üí©

  The `make clean` command gets rid of all compiled output.
